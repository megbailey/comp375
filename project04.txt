Update this file so that it contains the following info.
Submissions where this file has not been completed will NOT be accepted (i.e.
will receive a grade of 0).

1. Partner 1's FULL Name:
   Partner 1's USD Email Address:
   Partner 2's FULL Name:
   Partner 2's USD Email Address:

2. A typed copy of USD's academic integrity pledge, followed by each partners'
   typed initials (as a way of "signing the pledge.").

   The academic integrity pledge can be found on page 3 of
   the document found here: https://www.sandiego.edu/conduct/documents/HonorCode.pdf
   To be clear, it is the text that starts, "I pledge to demonstrate...".

3. The estimated number of hours spent working on the project.
   Break this down into three categories:
		- Time spent partner 1 spent working alone
		- Time spent partner 2 spent working alone
		- Time spent working together

4. A list of missing features and/or known bugs.

5. The number of project bucks you are spending on this project. 
   Remember that one project buck buys you a 24-hour deadline extension.
   However, if you are working with a partner, you must each spend a buck to
   get a 24-hour extension (i.e. 2 total bucks spent).
   You may each spend 0.5 bucks to get a 12-hour extension (i.e. 1 total buck
   between the two of you).
   No other fractional amounts of bucks may be used.

6. Any feedback you with to give me relating the project (e.g. Was it
   interesting? How could it be improved?)
